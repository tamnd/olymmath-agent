This repository is the toolchain of [olymmath](https://github.com/tamnd/olymmath). olymmath collects the problems and the solutions of all mathematical olympiads. It puts the human text first and shows the source of each text. The site is at https://olymmath.tamnd.com.

The `om` binary does these tasks:

- It builds the site from the content repository.
- It checks the content files and reports the errors.
- It harvests the sources and keeps each capture in a raw store (milestone M3).
- It merges duplicate problems and selects one canonical statement for each problem (milestone M4).
- It writes and grades AI solutions, with a label on each (milestone M7).

## Install

Download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/tamnd/olymmath-agent/releases). Each archive has a checksum and a build attestation. To check an archive, use this command:

```sh
gh attestation verify om_v0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz --repo tamnd/olymmath-agent
```

You can also build from the source. You need Go 1.27 or later.

```sh
go install github.com/tamnd/olymmath-agent/cmd/om@latest
```

## Use

Get the content repository and build the site:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tamnd/olymmath
om check -content olymmath
om site build -content olymmath -out build/site
```

Open `build/site/index.html` in a browser, or serve the directory with any static file server.

Use `om help` to see all the commands.
